<h1> Python Programming Language </h1>

<h3>So the question is, "Why Python?"</h3>

Python is a widely used programming language. 

Beacause it is:

• High-level: Python automates low-level operations such as memory management. It leaves the programmer with a bit less control but has many benefits including code readability and minimal code expressions.

• General-purpose: Python is built to be used in all contexts and environments. An example for a non-general-purpose language is PHP.

• Dynamically typed: Every variable in Python can reference any type of data. A single expression may evaluate to data of different types at different times. Due to that, the following code is possible:
if something:
 x = 1
else:
 x = 'this is a string'
print(x)

• Strongly typed: During program execution, you are not allowed to do anything that's incompatible with the type of data you're working with. For example, there are no hidden conversions from strings to numbers; a string made out of digits will never be treated as a number unless you convert it explicitly:

1 + '1' # raises an error
1 + int('1') # results with 2

• Beginner friendly :): Python's syntax and structure are very intuitive. It is high level and provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It has a large, comprehensive standard library and many easy-to-install 3rd party libraries.

In this section various basic coodes are added for practising and uderstanding of the Python codes.

A roadmap to learn Python is added below for better approach.
