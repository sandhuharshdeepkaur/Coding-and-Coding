<h3>Do you know the difference between Coder and Programmer?</h3>

- Coder is considered as the least trained or experienced level of programmer. They are usually given tasks that are pretty straightforward to write code. If you heard Junior Developer or Junior Programmer you can call then Coder.

- Programmers are involved in a specific part of the project. A programmer is someone who writes/creates computer software or applications by the given set of programming instructions.

- Then comes the Developers. They are involved with a greater understanding of the full project scope. A developer is an individual that builds and creates software and applications. He or she writes, debugs, and executes the source code of a software application. The developer also knows as Software Developer, Software Engineer, Computer Programmer, Programmer, or Software Coder.
